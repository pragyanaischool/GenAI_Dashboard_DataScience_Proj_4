# Restaurant Management Dashboard

This is a Streamlit-based dashboard for visualizing and analyzing restaurant management data. The dashboard reads data from a CSV file (`test_data.csv`), processes it, and presents various insights related to restaurant sales, staff performance, and item popularity.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Running the Dashboard

To run the dashboard, execute the script `restaurant_management_dashboard.py`. The dashboard will be accessible in your web browser.

```bash

streamlit run restaurant_management_dashboard.py

```

## Overview

The Restaurant Management Dashboard provides the following insights:

1\. **Total Sales and Monthly Sales:**

   - Select a month to view the total sale for that month.

   - Visualize monthly sales for each food/drink item.

2\. **Category-wise Analysis:**

   - Select a category to view the total sale for that category.
